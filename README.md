# Augur DAO

AugurDAO is intended to receive funds gradually over time, using a mechanism such as OpenZeppelin's [VestingWallet](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/finance/VestingWallet.sol).

### WrappedReputationToken

Wraps an Augur Reputation Token so that it has the functionality expected by AugurDAO.

## Tests
